<p> Dunamn High's compound is much bigger than that of my previous school. It has lush greenery around the school which is 
  pleasing to the eye. It also has a resource media library that allows students to carry out their revision there. There 
  are multiple science labs around the school for students to conduct practicals.</p>
<p> The school was built when there was a need to provide an opportunity for students who wanted to study in the midst of student-led
  protests in the many years ago.</p>
